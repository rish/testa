Is this a user queuing system using RethinkDB? Nope ... [Chuck Testa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJP1DphOWPs)

## Prerequisites

Make sure the RethinkDB build matches the driver version otherwise you cannot connect. Makes perfect semantical sense!

Current version of RethinkDB that is working for me:
`server: 2.0.1 (manually built binary)` and `client: 2.0.0 (npm)`
