Is this a user queuing system using RethinkDB? Nope ... [Chuck Testa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJP1DphOWPs)

## Prerequisites

Make sure the RethinkDB build matches the driver version otherwise you cannot connect. Makes perfect semantical sense!

Current version of RethinkDB that is working for me:
`server: 2.0.1 (manually built binary)` and `client: 2.0.0 (npm)`

### TODO

- [ ] Refactor basic queries to be more elegant
- [ ] Possibly set up middleware for express to communicate more expressively with RethinkDB
- [ ] Set up the view layer and asset pipeline
- [ ] Update this TODO list
